##	Features

* Full transparent encryption, containers appear as removable disks in Windows Explorer.
* Compatible with Linux encryption: dm-crypt and LUKS. Linux shell scripts support deniable encryption on Linux.
* Explorer program lets you browse containers when you don't have administrator permissions.
* Supports smartcards and security tokens.
* Encrypted containers can be a file, a partition, or a whole disk.
* Opens legacy volumes created with FreeOTFE
* Runs on Windows Vista onwards (see note below for 64 bit versions).
* Supports many hash (including SHA-512, RIPEMD-320, Tiger) and encryption algorithms (Including AES, Twofish, and Serpent) in several modes (CBC, LRW, and XTS).
* Optional 'key files' let you use a thumb-drive as a key.
* Portable mode doesn't need to be installed and leaves little trace on 3rd party PCs (administrator rights needed).
* Deniable encryption in case of 'rubber hose cryptography'.
* Considered the most easy to use encryption program for Windows.

**Please note this is a Beta version with some known limitations. Particularly on 64 bit Windows the text 'Test Mode' is shown on the desktop.**
	
## New in version v6.3β

 	* Simplified open and create container dialogs by removing 'hidden' containers options
 	* Creating hidden containers is now through separate dialogs, which is easier and less error prone 
	* Added experimental feature to create LUKS containers
	* Minor UI improvements, including the option to remember the window position
	* Reviewed and simplified all the text used in the application to use less technical language
  * A new menu time shows the recommended 'hidden' offset, so hidden containers can be used without memorizing a number
  * More clearly separated LUKS and dm-crypt options in the UI, to prevent LUKs containers being accidentally opened as dm-crypt  
 
  
## New features in version 6.2β

 * Change of name to 'LibreCrypt'
 * Many UI bugs fixed - see [Issue 20](https://github.com/t-d-k/doxbox/issues/20)
 * Improved support for GPT partitioned discs.
 * Improved new password dialog.
 * Improved partition information when running as non-admin.

## Release notes
*Important: LibreCrypt in Portable mode will not work on Windows Vista and later 64 bit versions without a extra step before use.*

	* LUKs partitions on LVM volumes, or LVM volumes in LUKS partitions cannot be accessed due to Windows limitations
	*	To run in portable mode, you need to have admin rights.
	*	LibreCrypt does not support encryption of the operating system partition, for this we recommend Ubuntu Linux or DiskCryptor.

*LibreCrypt installed on Windows Vista and later 64 bit versions adds the text "Test Mode" to the Windows desktop. Please see the documentation for details on removing this.*

### Known bugs

	* LibreCrypt cannot access LVM containers without an additional filesystem driver that understands LVM. No such filesystem driver exists for Windows versions later than XP
	* LibreCrypt cannot access ext2,3,4 volumes without an additional filesystem driver that can read ext2.
	* Installing the LibreCrypt drivers may enable malware specifically written to take advantage of it to access files as administrator [see issue #38](https://github.com/t-d-k/LibreCrypt/issues/38)  
	* LibreCrypt may not be able to access internal disks where a LUKS volume was created using the whole volume, instead of a partition [see issue #30](https://github.com/t-d-k/LibreCrypt/issues/30)   

### Installing

	* On Windows 8 please turn off 'Safe Boot' and disklocker before installing.
	* There has been a report that Kaspersky anti-virus falsely reports LibreCrypt as having the 'generic.Trojan' virus, please disable or replace this before installing.

	* Please follow these instructions to run LibreCrypt in portable mode on 64 bit Windows; if you do not do this you will get the error "Windows requires a digitally signed driver" when starting the drivers. There is no need to do this if LibreCrypt is installed.
		+ Start LibreCrypt, click 'No' on the prompt to start the portable drivers, and 'OK' on the warning dialog about not having any loaded drivers.
		+ Click the Tools->"Allow Test-signed drivers" menu item.
		+ Reboot	
		+ After rebooting the words "Test Mode" appear in the four corners of the Desktop. Please see the documentation for details on removing this.
		
	* LibreCrypt needs to be run as administrator the first time it is run. After that it can be run as an ordinary user. 

#### Upgrading

	* This release has changes to the drivers, if upgrading from previous versions of LibreCrypt,DoxBox or FreeOTFE please completely uninstall the old version first
	*	Support for the following cyphers will be removed in a future version, please convert to another: xor, plain, single DES. Ditto for the 'plain' hash. 
	* Backwards compatibility with older versions of FreeOTFE (before 5.21) will be removed in version 6.3. Please convert any FreeOTFE volumes. This can be done by creating a new 'container' and copying the files across.

####	Passwords
*These issues relate to passwords (keyphrases) containing non-ASCII characters, e.g. accented letters and non Latin scripts, not to ASCII special characters like '$&^'.*

*	The handling of keyphrases containing non-ASCII characters will change in a future version. This change will not be backwards compatible. So in this version it is recommended to use only ASCII characters in keyphrases.
*	There are possible bugs in opening volumes created with FreeOTFE with non-ASCII characters. If you experience problems, please use the legacy app to change the password to an ASCII one and retry. Alternatively move the files to a native container.
